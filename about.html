      <p><strong>By Frida Ikirezi Kayiranga</strong></p>
      <p>As a student who faced new challenges at university, I learned the value of sharing experiences and connecting with others. Voice of Campus is a space where every journey matters—where students can celebrate their achievements, talk openly about what they’re struggling with, and build a supportive community together. Accessibility is important to me because everyone deserves to participate and be heard. Thank you for joining and contributing to our story.</p>

      <h2 id="accessibility-heading">Accessibility Commitment</h2>
        <p><strong>Why accessibility matters to me:</strong> I believe every student should be able to access and enjoy these stories, no matter their abilities or background. I want Voice of Campus to be a place where everyone feels welcome and included.</p>
