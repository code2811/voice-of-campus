			<h2 id="experience-heading">My Campus Experience</h2>
			<p><strong>By Frida Ikirezi Kayiranga</strong></p>
			<p>When I started university, I had never coded before. Learning programming was a real struggle for me, and honestly, it still is sometimes. I remember missing some assignments just because I forgot to check Canvas, and it felt like everyone else was moving so much faster than I was. It’s tough trying to keep up when you feel left behind, but I’m learning that it’s okay to go at my own pace. If you’re struggling too, you’re not alone—just keep going, and don’t be afraid to ask for help.</p>
